# OptiSigns – OptiBot Mini-Clone Take-Home Test

> ship it in ~ 10 focused hours. Everything else is extra credit.

---

# 0. Warm-up (15 min)

1. Create a free optisigns.com trial account and chat with OptiBot so you know what you’re cloning.

2. Open a free account on your chosen AI platform:
   - OpenAI (platform.openai.com)
   - Google Gemini (aistudio.google.com)

---

# 1. Scrape ⇒ Markdown (~3 h)

**Goal:** prove you can ingest messy web content and normalize it.

- Pull ≥ 30 articles from support.optisigns.com.
- Convert each article to clean Markdown.
- Save each file as `<slug>.md` (or whatever scheme you like).
- Preserve relative links, code blocks, and headings. Remove nav/ads.

> **Hint:** you can use Zendesk API to read the article.

# 2. Build AI Assistant & Programmatically Load Vector Store (~2 h)

> API upload is mandatory—no UI drag-and-drop here.

## Create the Assistant

Use OpenAI Playground UI or Google AI Studio to set up your assistant.

### System prompt (verbatim)

```text
You are OptiBot, the customer-support bot for OptiSigns.com.

• Tone: helpful, factual, concise.
• Only answer using the uploaded docs.
• Max 5 bullet points; else link to the doc.
• Cite up to 3 "Article URL:" lines per reply.
```

### Upload Knowledge Base

1. Via Python script, upload Markdown files to your chosen AI service’s vector store/knowledge base via API (OpenAI Vector Store or Google Gemini equivalent).

   - Upload files to OpenAI | Gemini API docs
   - Attach files to Vector Stores
   - Chunking strategy is up to you; just explain it in the README.
   - Log how many files and chunks were embedded.

2. Quick sanity check

   Test your assistant in the Playground (OpenAI) or AI Studio (Gemini), and ask:

   > "How do I add a YouTube video?"

   Take a screenshot showing a correct answer with citations.

You can learn more about the overall OpenAI Agent or Google Gemini API approach.

# 3. Deploy Scraper as Daily Job (~2 h)

- Wrap your scraper-uploader in `main.py`.
- Dockerize (`Dockerfile`).
- Schedule it to run once per day on DigitalOcean or any cloud/public hosting platform (e.g. Railway, Render, Fly.io, AWS, GCP).

## Job must

1. Re-scrape.
2. Detects new/updated articles (hash, Last-Modified, etc.).
3. Upload only the delta.

Log counts:

- added
- updated
- skipped

Provide a link to job logs or last run artefact.

# Deliverables

| Item | Must Have |
|------|-----------|
| **GitHub repo** | Please DO NOT name your github repo "optisigns" something, just give it cryptic name so future candidate not easy to find when search optisigns. |
| | Clear commits; no hard-coded keys (use `.env.sample`). |
| **Dockerfile** | `docker run -e API_KEY=... main.py` runs once and exits `0`. |
| **README (≤ 1 page)** | • setup<br>• how to run locally<br>• link to daily job logs<br>• screenshot of assistant answering a sample question |
| **Screenshot** | Assistant correctly answers sample questions with cited URLs. |

# Set up 1h Project Reviews

We will discuss

- Your overall concept understanding of the project
- Your approach, solution
- How do you learn something new like this if you haven’t learned it before
- Your thoughts, suggestions on how OptiBots can be improved, what potential challenges you think we will be facing
